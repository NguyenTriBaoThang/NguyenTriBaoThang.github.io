# Deploying a Serverless Student Information Management Website with AWS

> **Welcome to the hands-on workshop!**  
> Build a **serverless** web application using modern AWS services to manage student information in a **secure**, **efficient**, and **cost-effective** way.

## Overview

This workshop will guide you step by step in building a **serverless website** using powerful AWS services to manage student information. The application supports:  
- **Input and output student data** with fields: **Student ID**, **Full Name**, **Class**, **Birth Date**, and **Email**.  
- A **user-friendly interface** designed with **Tailwind CSS** for a smooth user experience.  
- **Security**: Uses **API Key** via **API Gateway** to authenticate requests.  
- **Notifications**: Sends confirmation emails and backups via **AWS SES**.  
- **Automated Backup**: Backs up data from **DynamoDB** to **S3** on a schedule.  

By using serverless services like **S3**, **DynamoDB**, **Lambda**, **API Gateway**, **CloudFront**, and **SES**, you will learn how to deploy an application that:  
- **Requires no server management**.  
- **Saves costs** with a pay-per-use model.  
- **Scales automatically** based on traffic.  
- **Optimizes global performance** with low latency.
